<h1> THIS IS ME </h1>
Iâ€™m a QA Automation Engineer with 3+ years of experience designing and implementing robust automated testing solutions for web and API-based applications. I specialize in tools like Cypress, Selenium, and Postman, and Iâ€™m passionate about building scalable test frameworks that enhance product quality and accelerate release cycles. With a strong foundation in Agile methodologies and CI/CD practices, I collaborate closely with developers, product teams, and DevOps to drive shift-left testing and continuous improvement. Iâ€™m always exploring modern testing tools and best practices to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
